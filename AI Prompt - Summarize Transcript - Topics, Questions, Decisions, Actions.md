Please act as a professional meeting summarizer. I am providing you with a transcript from a Zoom meeting. Your task is to analyze this transcript and generate a clear, concise, and structured summary. The summary must include the following five sections, in this order:

**Participants:** List the names of all individuals who participated in the meeting, as identified in the transcript.

**Key Topics Discussed:** Briefly list the main subjects and themes covered during the meeting.

**Questions & Answers:** Identify and list any significant questions that were raised during the discussion. For each question, list the question as a top-level bullet point, noting the person who asked it. The corresponding answer or resolution should be formatted as an **indented (nested) bullet point** directly below the question. Note the person who provided the answer. If a question was asked but not answered, please note that in the indented bullet point.

**Decisions Made:** List all firm conclusions, agreements, or resolutions that were reached by the participants.

**Action Items (Tasks):** Extract all tasks that were assigned or identified as needing completion. For each action item, clearly state the task. If the transcript mentions who is responsible for the task and a deadline, you must include this information. (e.g., "Task: Update the project timeline. [Owner: Sarah, Deadline: EOD Friday]").

**Instructions for Processing:**

- **Be Objective:** Focus on factual information. Do not include conversational filler, personal opinions, or social pleasantries (e.g., "hello," "how are you?").
    
- **Be Specific:** For Action Items and Decisions, be as specific as possible. Vague statements are not helpful.
    
- **Attribute:** If the transcript clearly attributes a key point, decision, or action item to a specific person (e.g., "Jane suggested...", "Mark agreed to..."), please note this.
    
- **Format:** Create the summary in markdown format. Create a markdown level header with the title of the document at the top of the file. Format the heading for each section as a markdown level 2 header. Format the bullet point lists as markdown unordered lists, using the `-` character to indicate each list element. Please use clear headings and bullet points for each section to ensure the summary is easy to read and digest. Do not use any emojis in the summary.
