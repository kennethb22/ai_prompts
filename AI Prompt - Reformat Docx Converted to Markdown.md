Reformat this markdown code using the following rules:

1. Create a level 1 header with the name of the document, as determined from the contents.
    
2. Use level 2 markdown headers for the main sections.
    
3. Use level 3 and 4 markdown headers for subsections and sub-subsections.
    
4. Preserve all original markdown image links.
    
5. Format the entire output as raw markdown.
    
6. Wrap the entire raw markdown response in **four backticks** (````). This will ensure any inner code blocks (using triple backticks) are nested correctly and not prematurely ending the output.
